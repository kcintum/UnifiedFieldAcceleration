# The Universal Acceleration Constant: Unifying Disparate Fields

This repository contains the LaTeX source for the paper "The Universal Acceleration Constant: A Unifying Framework for Micro–Macro Energy, Momentum, and Time Dynamics." 

## Overview
This work rigorously derives a universal constant, \(K^2\), from the second derivative of an exponential process. It establishes that:
  
    p_micro = K * p_macro
    E_micro = K^2 * E_macro

By applying a double inversion that transforms exponential functions into logarithmic ones, the model captures the complete recycling dynamics of energy flow. This framework unifies classical mechanics, general relativity, and quantum mechanics, completing aspects of Einstein’s unified field vision and refining black hole thermodynamics via Hawking radiation.

## Significance
As everything in life is a system and any system can be created from a subset within set;The universal \(K^2\) framework provides precise, probabilistic predictions that replace heuristic approximations. Its applications span astrophysics, fluid dynamics, finance, biology, artificial intelligence,sustainable energy and quantum computing and every other single field of study laying the foundation for a new interdisciplinary field: Unified Systems Dynamics.
